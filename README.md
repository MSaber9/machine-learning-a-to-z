Udemy's Machine Learning A - Z course Exercises

# Overview

This is a place where I put the exercises I did when I was studying [Udemy's Machine Learning A - Z course](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/). In addition to that, I added some notes basically to remember things after I finished the course.

# Prerequisites

As part of the course they they show you how to install the following software:

- R https://cran.r-project.org/ : It is just downloading the package there, but if you are on macOS, you can install it with homebrew as following:

```
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz
brew install r
```

- RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/ : This is the IDE to work with R. They teach everything in Python and R, but it is good to have them both.

- Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/download : One Python package management system(among other things) that is very common on data science: powerful and easy to use. You can also use [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). It is smaller in size and give the starting point.
